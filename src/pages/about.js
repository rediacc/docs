                The calendar showed September 2018. I had resigned (was an extremely difficult resignation) from the 
                institution where I worked as a software engineer, wanting to code my own dreams. I could only sleep 
                for maybe 4-5 hours due to excitement; I was working day and night. This pace continued like this for 
                about 5-6 months. One day, two police officers showed up at my door. They told me that an investigation 
                had been opened against me and that I was being called to give a statement.
              </p>

              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                It was a very long day. I spoke with police officers, a commissioner, a doctor, and finally, the prosecutor. 
                All without any lawyer support. In short, they took my statement and then seized my high-tech computers 
                and many disk drives from my home 'for a short time' to clone the data.
              </p>

              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                Until that time I had covered all my expenses, including my rent payments, car loan payment, and all 
                the expenses of my startup entirely with other high-interest loans. I had no backup of my work, and 
                even if I had, what could I have done? I had used completely on-premises hardware, and I no longer had 
                the financial means to purchase new equipment. To pay off my debts and continue living with my wife 
                and son, I had to return to a salaried job.
              </p>

              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                It took me "20 months" to get my devices back, and 3-4 years later, a non-prosecution decision was 
                made, proving my innocence. During this time, I had drifted far from my dreams and started living in 
                another world. The lawyers of the banks I owed money to were calling me every week. After the police, 
                lawyers and bailiffs from three different banks started visiting our home.

              <div className={styles.divider}></div>

              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                Years later, I kept thinking about what I could do to prevent such a problem from happening again in 
                the future. I needed a tool that would allow me to move my systems to another environment whenever I 
                wanted, activate them whenever needed, back them up easily, and store them securely no matter where 
                I moved them. Virtual machines weren't the answer, as I required native performance without the overhead 
                of virtualization.
              </p>

              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                In 2021, I watched NetworkChuck's video, "you need to learn Docker RIGHT NOW!! // Docker Containers 101". 
                Then I was shocked. I wanted to go out to the balcony and scream as loud as I could. I wished I had 
                known about this technology earlier!
              </p>

              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                Still, this technology didn't solve all my problems. Moving container files from one system to another 
                was difficult. I faced compatibility issues with file ownership, and most importantly, as the data size 
                grew, transferring it took longer. Moreover, I had to keep services offline until system migration 
                finished and the technology almost has nothing about security.

              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                It all started with the development of a portable file system logic. From there, I integrated a backup 
                module. Then came one of the most critical challenges: enabling live system transfers with minimal 
                downtime, regardless of data size. Then I added unique features based on my needs.

                This is how Rediacc was bornâ€”a product forged through the toughest moments of my life. Now, it's 
                available to everyone. Use it and don't let anything hold your business backâ€”be ready to accelerate.

              <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>The Meaning of Rediacc</h2>
              <div className={styles.divider}></div>

              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                The name "Rediacc" has a rich dual meaning that reflects both our technological roots and our 
                forward-thinking vision.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.subsectionTitle}>Technical Origin</h3>
              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                Initially, Rediacc was conceptualized as a GPU-accelerated version of Redis, the popular key-value 
                store. While Redis stands for "Remote Dictionary Server," Rediacc was conceived as "Remote Dictionary 
                Accelerated"â€”representing an evolution toward greater speed and performance.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.subsectionTitle}>Philosophical Significance</h3>
              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                Over time, Rediacc took on an additional meaning: "Ready to Accelerate." This interpretation perfectly 
                captures the essence of our current solution. Rediacc embodies a harmonious blend of preparation and 
                velocityâ€”symbolizing readiness for rapid change and progress.
