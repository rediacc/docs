## Key Messages Emphasized

### Primary Message
**"With Rediacc, production damage from AI is impossible"**

### Supporting Messages
1. **Instant Cloning**: AI works on perfect copies created in seconds
2. **Time Travel**: Restore from any AI disaster in 1 minute
3. **MCP Protocol**: Native integration with hard boundaries
4. **Complete Audit**: Every AI action tracked and reversible

## Technical Highlights

### MCP Protocol Support
```json
{
  "rediacc": {
    "sandbox_mode": true,
    "auto_clone": true,
    "production_access": "denied"
  }
}
```

### Instant Cloning Capability
- 100TB databases cloned in seconds
- Copy-on-Write technology (no storage overhead)
- AI operates exclusively on disposable clones
- Production remains completely untouchable

### Protection Metrics
| Scenario | Traditional | Rediacc |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Database Deletion | 100% loss | 0% loss, 1-min restore |
| Data Exfiltration | 1.2TB stolen | <2GB maximum |
| Credential Theft | Full compromise | Impossible (encrypted) |
| Production Access | Direct damage | Blocked completely |

## ROI Impact
- Prevented losses per incident: $2M-$10M
- Rediacc investment: ~$100k/year
- ROI: 1,900% - 9,900%
- Payback period: <1 month after preventing single incident
