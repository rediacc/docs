# Our Profit-Sharing Model

At Rediacc, we believe the traditional employment model could be improved. That's why we've developed an alternative approach - a transparent profit-sharing collaboration framework designed to treat contributors as partners in our success.

<!-- truncate -->

## Our Approach to Collaboration

Our model differs from traditional structures in several key ways:

### Direct Profit Participation
Unlike traditional companies that offer fixed salaries with occasional bonuses, our experts directly participate in the company's net profits. Every quarter, profits are distributed transparently among all contributors based on clear, predetermined formulas.

### Performance-Based Reality
Your compensation directly reflects your contribution and performance. We use an Expert Coefficient system combined with quarterly performance evaluations to ensure fair and merit-based distribution.

### Work Autonomy
- **Flexible scheduling**: Work when and where you're most productive
- **Results-oriented**: Focus on delivering quality work on time
- **Minimal meetings**: Brief weekly sync-ups only when necessary
- **Asynchronous first**: Work in your timezone, at your pace

## How Our Model Works

### The Expert System
Collaborators join as "Experts" with specific coefficients based on their skills, experience, and expected contribution. This partnership level helps determine profit sharing allocations.

### Profit Distribution Structure
Our net profits flow through a transparent distribution system:
- **Team Share**: A significant portion of profits distributed among active experts
- **Capital Share**: Reserved for company growth and sustainability
- **Referral Commissions**: Direct rewards for bringing in business

### Quarterly Settlements
Every quarter, we calculate and distribute earnings based on:
- Fixed share - guaranteed baseline
- Performance share - multiplied by your individual performance

### Performance Evaluation
Our evaluation system is comprehensive yet fair:
- Manager evaluation
- Peer reviews from colleagues
- Self-assessment
- AI-assisted arbitration for objectivity

Performance influences quarterly earnings, with high performers potentially earning above their baseline share.

## The Entrepreneurship Path

For early experts, we offer equity participation after one year of collaboration. This provides ownership opportunities and long-term alignment with company goals.

## What This Means for You

### Financial Transparency
- Understand how profits are calculated
- See how your work contributes to earnings
- Understand the distribution formula
- No hidden compensation structures

### Work-Life Integration
- Choose your working hours
- Work from anywhere in the world
- Flexible time-off arrangements
- Maintain sustainable pace

### Professional Growth
- Cross-functional contribution opportunities
- Expert coefficient advancement
- Knowledge sharing sessions
- Direct impact on company direction

## Our Collaboration Principles

### Results Over Hours
We focus on measuring success through:
- Quality of deliverables
- Meeting commitments
- Innovation and problem-solving
- Team collaboration

### Distributed Leadership
Every expert has autonomy in their domain. We believe in:
- Distributed decision-making
- Open information flow
- Transparent planning
- Collective ownership

### Sustainable Excellence
We're focused on sustainable growth:
- Avoiding unsustainable work practices
- Emphasis on code quality over speed
- Investment in tools and automation
- Continuous learning and improvement

## Who Thrives in This Model?

Our model works best for individuals who:

### Are Self-Directed
- Can manage your own time and priorities
- Don't need constant supervision
- Take ownership of outcomes
- Communicate proactively

### Value Transparency
- Appreciate open financial models
- Want to understand business mechanics
- Prefer direct communication
- Embrace feedback culture

### Seek Real Impact
- Want your work to contribute to earnings
- Desire influence over company direction
- Value merit-based advancement
- Think like an owner, not an employee

## The Selection Process

We're selective because our model requires exceptional individuals:

- **Initial Discussion**: Understanding mutual fit
- **Technical Evaluation**: Demonstrating expertise
- **Collaboration Assessment**: Ensuring cultural alignment
- **Agreement Review**: Transparent discussion of terms
- **Contract Finalization**: Formal expert partnership

## Real Impact

Experts can typically expect:
- Quarterly profit distributions
- Performance-based multipliers
- Merit-based compensation growth
- Correlation between company success and personal earnings

## Beyond Compensation

### Innovation Time
Contribute to any area of the company, not just your primary domain. Cross-functional contributions are recognized and rewarded.

### Knowledge Sharing
Quarterly knowledge-sharing sessions where experts teach each other, building collective capability.

### Tool Freedom
Use the tools and technologies that make you most productive. We provide resources, not restrictions.

## Common Questions

### "How is this different from contracting?"
Contractors work for predetermined rates on specific projects. Our experts share directly in company profits with no ceiling on earnings. You're a partner, not a vendor.

### "What about job security?"
Our model aims to create aligned incentives. When the company succeeds, contributors benefit proportionally. Poor performance is addressed through our transparent evaluation system.

### "How do promotions work?"
Expert coefficients are reviewed annually. Advancement is based on demonstrated impact, peer recognition, and business contribution - not politics or tenure.

### "What if I prefer traditional employment?"
That's understandable. Our model works best for those comfortable with variability and self-management. Traditional employment may be more suitable if you prefer fixed income and structured environments.

## The Future We're Building

We believe this model offers an alternative approach to work:
- Aligned incentives between company and contributors
- Merit-based advancement focused on results
- Sustainable work-life integration
- Transparent and fair compensation

## Join the Revolution

If you're tired of:
- Fixed salaries that don't reflect your contribution
- Corporate politics and artificial hierarchies
- Being treated as a resource rather than a partner
- Opaque compensation and advancement systems

And you're excited about:
- Direct profit participation
- Complete work autonomy
- Transparent evaluation systems
- Building something transformative

Then we want to hear from you.
