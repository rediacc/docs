## Troubleshooting Dashboard Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Dashboard Not Loading
1. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify login credentials
   - Check session expiration
   - Clear cookies and re-login

2. **Network Problems**
   - Test API connectivity
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify proxy configuration

3. **Browser Issues**
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
   - Try incognito/private mode
   - Update to latest browser version
   - Disable conflicting extensions

#### Data Display Problems

**Stale or Missing Data:**
- Check last refresh timestamp
- Manually refresh page (F5)
- Verify API endpoints responding
- Check browser console for errors

**Incorrect Counts:**
- Ensure proper team selection
- Verify user permissions
- Check filter settings
- Compare with audit logs

**Widget Loading Errors:**
- Check specific API calls in Network tab
- Verify vault decryption working
- Ensure master password correct
- Review error messages

#### Performance Optimization

**Slow Dashboard Loading:**
1. Close unnecessary browser tabs
2. Disable resource-heavy extensions
3. Check network latency to API
4. Consider using Edge/Chrome for best performance

**High Memory Usage:**
- Limit dashboard refresh frequency
- Reduce activity feed history
- Close other Rediacc Console tabs
- Restart browser periodically

### Getting Support

When issues persist:

1. **Collect Information**
   - Screenshot of the issue
   - Browser console errors (F12)
   - Network tab HAR file
   - Time of occurrence

2. **Check Resources**
   - System status page
   - Known issues list
   - Admin notifications
   - Audit log entries

3. **Escalation Path**
   - Contact system administrator
   - Submit support ticket
   - Include collected information

### Vault Encryption Warning

If you see a warning banner stating "Your company has not enabled vault encryption yet. The master password you entered will not be used.":

**What it means:**
- Your organization hasn't activated client-side encryption
- Sensitive data is encrypted server-side only
- The master password field during login is ignored

**Resolution:**
1. Contact your system administrator
2. Request vault encryption activation
3. Once enabled, the warning will disappear
4. Your master password will then be required for decrypting vault data

**Security Impact:**
- Data is still encrypted at rest
- Server administrators could potentially access vault contents
- Client-side encryption adds an extra security layer
   - Specify impact level

## Best Practices

### Daily Usage
- Start each day with dashboard review
- Set up browser bookmark for quick access
- Use multiple monitors for persistent display
- Configure browser notifications

### Team Coordination
- Share dashboard screenshots in team channels
- Establish resource usage thresholds
- Create escalation procedures
- Document standard responses

### Capacity Planning
- Monitor resource trends weekly
