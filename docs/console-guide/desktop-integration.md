# Desktop Integration

The desktop integration features for Rediacc Console have been removed. The application is now focused on web-based access with CLI tools for local operations.

## Alternative Solutions

For local system integration and advanced operations, please use the Rediacc CLI tools:

- **rediacc-cli**: Main CLI for API operations
- **rediacc-cli-sync**: File synchronization with rsync
- **rediacc-cli-term**: Interactive SSH terminal access

Please refer to the CLI documentation for detailed usage instructions.
