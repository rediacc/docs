## Key Discrepancies Found

### Critical Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Icon Inconsistencies**: Several icons in documentation don't match actual UI
2. **Screenshots Outdated**: Most screenshots need updating to current UI
3. **Missing Tutorial Reference**: security-hardening.md not listed in tutorials index

## Validation Methodology

1. **Live Testing**: Logged into console with provided credentials (admin@rediacc.io)
2. **Feature Verification**: Clicked through each documented feature
3. **UI Comparison**: Compared documented UI elements with actual interface
4. **Functionality Testing**: Tested search, filtering, and dialog interactions
5. **Screenshot Capture**: Documented current UI state for comparison

## Strengths of Documentation

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major features are documented
2. **Well-Structured**: Clear organization and navigation
3. **Detailed Explanations**: Good depth of technical information
4. **User-Focused**: Multiple learning paths for different roles
5. **Cross-Referenced**: Good linking between related topics

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 - Critical
1. **Rewrite repositories.md** to accurately reflect repository storage provisioning functionality
2. **Investigate** if there's a separate Git/Docker credentials interface that wasn't found

### Priority 2 - Important
1. **Update all screenshots** to match current UI (2025-07-09)
2. **Add security-hardening.md** to tutorials index
3. **Document vault encryption warning** that appears at bottom of pages

### Priority 3 - Nice to Have
1. **Update icon references** throughout documentation
2. **Add more examples** with populated data states
3. **Include troubleshooting** for common deployment errors

## Files Created During Validation
