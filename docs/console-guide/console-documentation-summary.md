- Task lifecycle from creation to completion
- Status types and priority levels
- Stale task detection and handling
- Retry mechanisms and error handling
- Export functionality for analysis
- Real-time monitoring features
- Performance best practices

Queue States Documented:
- PENDING → ASSIGNED → PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED
- Stale task detection for stuck items
- Priority-based processing (Highest/High/Normal/Low)
- Retry counting and automatic requeue

### 5. System Settings Documentation (`system-live.md`)

Administrative guide covering:
- Company and personal vault settings
- User management with permission groups
- Team organization and access control
- Region and infrastructure management
- Bridge configuration and types
- Danger zone operations (emergency controls)
- Security features including encryption management
- Integration with CLI commands

Security Features:
- Emergency user blocking capabilities
- Complete vault export for backup
- Master encryption password management
- Role-based access control
- Audit trail tracking

## Key System Insights

### Architecture Understanding

1. **Communication Flow**: Console → Middleware API → Bridge → Machine
2. **Security Layers**: Token rotation, client-side encryption, vault protection
3. **Queue System**: Central task distribution with priority and retry logic
4. **Resource Organization**: Teams, regions, bridges, and machines hierarchy

### Technical Implementation

1. **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
2. **API Communication**: REST with token rotation
3. **Encryption**: AES client-side encryption for vaults
4. **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh for live data

### Best Practices Identified

1. **Security**: Never transmit encryption passwords, use token rotation
2. **Organization**: Consistent naming conventions, logical grouping
3. **Monitoring**: Regular dashboard checks, stale task management
4. **Maintenance**: Audit trail reviews, permission audits

## Screenshots Created

All screenshots were captured from live system testing:
- `console-dashboard-live.png` - Main dashboard view
- `console-resources-machines-live.png` - Machine management interface
- `console-queue-management-live.png` - Queue monitoring and control
- `console-system-settings-live.png` - Administrative settings

## CLI Integration

Each major feature includes CLI command equivalents:
- Authentication tokens shared between Console and CLI
- Same API endpoints and procedures
- Consistent resource management
- Unified permission system

## API Endpoints Documented

Key stored procedures referenced:
- Authentication: `CreateAuthenticationRequest`, `ValidateToken`
- Dashboard: `GetDashboardData`, `GetRecentActivity`
- Machines: `GetMachinesByTeam`, `CreateMachine`, `UpdateMachineVault`
- Queue: `GetQueueItems`, `CreateQueueItem`, `UpdateQueueItemStatus`
- System: `GetUsers`, `CreateRegion`, `UpdateEncryptionPassword`

## Validation Results

All documented features were:
1. Tested in live environment
2. Verified against actual UI behavior
3. Cross-referenced with CLAUDE.md architecture
4. Validated for technical accuracy
5. Checked for completeness

## Next Steps

1. Review and integrate new documentation files
2. Update existing documentation cross-references
3. Add these insights to troubleshooting guides
4. Create additional tutorials based on workflows
5. Develop API reference documentation

## Conclusion

The Rediacc Console documentation now comprehensively covers:
- User authentication and security
- System monitoring and dashboard
- Resource management (machines, teams)
- Queue operations and task management
- Administrative controls and settings
- Integration with CLI and API
- Best practices and troubleshooting

All documentation is based on live testing and accurately reflects the current system implementation.
