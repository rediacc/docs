## Findings & Corrections

### Documentation Updates Made:
1. Updated screenshot references from generic names to validated versions
2. All major features documented were found to be accurate
3. UI elements, icons, and layouts match the documentation

### Minor Observations:
1. Some timestamps show "Invalid Date" for newer entries - this appears to be a data issue, not documentation
2. The system shows an Elite subscription with 3,652 days remaining
3. Expert mode is enabled by default for the admin user

## Validation Limitations

### Not Validated (Due to Time/Access Constraints):
- Marketplace section
- Audit page details
- Architecture page
- Add/Edit dialogs for machines, users, teams
- Remote terminal functionality
- Actual queue task execution
- Export functionality
- Dark mode theme

## Recommendations

1. **Priority**: Validate remaining sections when time permits
2. **Screenshots**: Consider capturing more granular screenshots of dialogs and forms
3. **Cross-references**: Verify all internal documentation links work correctly
4. **CLI Integration**: Test and document CLI commands that correspond to Console operations

## Conclusion

The core Console documentation is accurate and reflects the actual system behavior. The main navigation, dashboard widgets, resource management, queue operations, and system settings all function as documented. The documentation provides a reliable guide for users of the Rediacc Console.
