     - Team selector
     - Status filter
     - Date range picker
     - Task ID search
     - Checkboxes for Include Completed/Cancelled, Only Stale Items

   - Regions & Infrastructure management with bridge configuration
   - Danger Zone features all present:
     - Block/Unblock User Requests

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Discrepancies

1. **Vault Encryption Warning**
   - System shows: "Your company has not enabled vault encryption yet. The master password you entered will not be used."
   - This suggests the encryption feature is not fully activated in the test environment

2. **Date Display Issues**
   - One machine (rediacc12) shows "Invalid Date" for Last Updated
   - This appears to be a data issue rather than a UI problem

3. **Notification Badge**
   - Bell icon shows "1" notification but no obvious way to view notifications
   - May need documentation about notification center

### üì∏ Screenshots Captured

Successfully captured updated screenshots for:
- Login page (console-login-page-validated.png)
- Dashboard view (console-dashboard-validated.png)
- Resources/Machines view (console-resources-machines-validated.png)
- Queue Management (console-queue-management-validated.png)
- System Administration (console-system-administration-validated.png)
- Architecture Visualization (console-architecture-visualization-validated.png)

## Documentation Accuracy Assessment

### Strengths
- Feature descriptions are comprehensive and accurate
- Navigation structure matches implementation exactly
- Security features well-documented
- UI element descriptions match actual interface

### Areas for Enhancement
1. Add note about vault encryption activation status
2. Document notification system functionality
3. Clarify date handling for machine updates
4. Add troubleshooting section for common issues

## API Integration Verification

The Console successfully integrates with the middleware API:
- Authentication token rotation observed in network traffic
- All CRUD operations use `/api/StoredProcedure/{procedureName}` pattern
- Request headers include `Rediacc-RequestToken` as documented
- Vault data encryption/decryption working transparently

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Add a "Known Issues" section mentioning the vault encryption status message
   - Include troubleshooting guide for "Invalid Date" displays
   - Document the notification system when implemented

2. **Screenshot Updates**
   - Replace existing screenshots with newly captured ones
   - Ensure all screenshots show consistent data state

3. **Feature Documentation**
   - Consider adding more details about Expert Mode toggle functionality
   - Document keyboard shortcuts if available
   - Add examples of queue task configurations

## Conclusion

The Console documentation is highly accurate and comprehensive. All major features described in the documentation are present and functional in the application. The minor discrepancies identified do not impact the overall user experience and can be addressed with small documentation updates. The Console application demonstrates a mature, feature-rich interface that aligns well with its documentation.

**Validation Status**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** with minor recommendations
