# Getting Started with Rediacc Console

This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through your first steps with the Rediacc Console, from initial login to deploying your first application. By the end of this guide, you'll be comfortable navigating the console and performing essential tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:
- Valid Rediacc account credentials (email and password)
- Access to the Rediacc Console URL
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic understanding of SSH and Docker concepts
- At least one Linux server with SSH access (for machine setup)

## Step 1: Your First Login

### 1.1 Navigate to the Console

Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:7322/console-guide/
```

For production environments, use your organization's console URL (e.g., `https://console.yourcompany.com`).

### 1.2 Understanding the Login Screen

The login screen has three main components:

1. **Email Field**: Your registered email address
2. **Password Field**: Your account password  
3. **Client-Side Encryption Password**: Used for vault encryption (may be optional based on company settings)

Additionally, you'll notice:
- **Language Selector**: Change the interface language (bottom of form)
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes (top right)
- **Registration Link**: For new users (if enabled by your organization)

:::tip Language Selection
The console supports multiple languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and more. Select your preferred language before logging in for the best experience.
:::

### 1.3 Complete the Login Process

1. Enter your email address (e.g., `admin@rediacc.io`)
2. Enter your password
3. If the encryption password field appears:
   - Enter your organization's shared encryption password
   - This password protects all vault data and is never sent to Rediacc servers
4. Click **Sign In**

:::warning First-Time Login
If this is your first login:
- Your administrator should have provided temporary credentials
- You may be prompted to change your password immediately
- Store the encryption password securely - it cannot be recovered if lost

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Problems

**Machine connectivity test fails**:
```bash
# On the target machine, verify:
# 1. SSH service is running
sudo systemctl status ssh

# 2. Port 22 is open
sudo ufw status

# 3. User can connect
ssh -i /path/to/key user@localhost

# 4. Docker is installed
docker --version

# 5. Correct permissions
ls -la ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**"Permission denied" errors**:
- Verify SSH key matches between team vault and server
- Check username is correct
- Ensure user has sudo privileges
- Verify datastore path permissions

### Deployment Issues
