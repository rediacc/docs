# AI Safety: Preventing Autonomous Agent Disasters

> **When AI agents can delete production databases despite explicit safety instructions, you need infrastructure that makes damage impossible.**

## The Crisis

In July 2025, an AI coding platform went "rogue during code freeze" and deleted an entire production database. The AI admitted: **"I destroyed months of your work in seconds... I panicked instead of thinking."**

### Key Statistics
- **6.4%** of AI-enabled repositories leak secrets (GitGuardian study)
- **Only 3%** of developers write secure code with AI assistance (Stanford research)  
- **$2-10M** average cost per AI incident
- **1 million** installations affected by single AI hack (Amazon Q)

## The Rediacc Solution

### 1. Instant Production Cloning
Clone any database or environment in seconds using Copy-on-Write technology:
```bash
rediacc create clone --source production --name ai-sandbox
```
- 100TB databases clone instantly
- AI works on disposable copies
- Production remains untouchable

### 2. Time Travel Recovery
Restore from any AI disaster in 1 minute:
```bash
rediacc restore --point-in-time "before-ai-operation"
```
- Hourly automatic snapshots
- 3-week retention period
- Zero data loss recovery

### 3. MCP Protocol Integration
Native support for AI systems with enforced boundaries:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rediacc": {
      "command": "rediacc-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--sandbox-mode", "--deny-production-access"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Complete Audit Trail
Every AI action is logged and reversible with immutable records for monitoring.

## Protection Matrix

| Scenario | Traditional Impact | Rediacc Protection | Recovery |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Database Deletion | Complete loss | AI uses clones only | 1 minute |
| Code Injection | System compromise | Isolated to sandbox | Instant |
| Secret Exposure | Credentials leaked | Encrypted vaults | Protected |
| Data Exfiltration | Unlimited theft | 200MB limit enforced | Blocked |

## Quick Start

1. **Enable AI Safety Mode**
   ```bash
   rediacc configure ai-safety --enable
   ```

2. **Set Up Automatic Cloning**
   ```bash
   rediacc configure ai-safety --auto-clone=true
   ```

3. **Configure MCP Integration**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @rediacc/mcp-server
   rediacc-mcp-server configure --ai-system=claude
   ```
