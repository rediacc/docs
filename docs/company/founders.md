# From Setback to Innovation

Born from personal adversity, Rediacc was created by Muhammed Fatih Bayraktar after his high-tech equipment was seized for 20 months. Without backups and forced to return to salaried work, this experience inspired him to develop a solution to prevent similar data disasters.

## The Journey

After discovering containerization in 2021, Muhammed built what Docker alone couldn't provide — a system enabling migration with under a minute downtime, regardless of data size. Rediacc evolved to include portable file systems, intelligent backups, and enhanced security features.

## The Vision

Rediacc was founded by Muhammed Fatih Bayraktar, a technical entrepreneur with a compelling personal story of data loss and recovery. After experiencing a 20-month seizure of his high-tech equipment without backups, he embarked on a journey to create the ultimate backup and recovery solution.

With expertise in high-performance systems, cloud technologies, and enterprise solutions, Muhammed combines technical acumen with a deep understanding of real-world business needs to drive Rediacc's innovation.

## The Philosophy

> "It's not just about technology—it's about making it possible for businesses to operate without fear of data loss or downtime. Every feature we build comes from understanding the real pain businesses face."  
> — Muhammed Fatih Bayraktar, Founder

## A Product Forged Through Life's Toughest Moments

Rediacc represents more than just a technical solution—it's a testament to resilience and innovation born from real-world challenges. What started as a personal tragedy transformed into a mission to ensure no business ever faces the same devastating data loss.

Today, Rediacc stands as a comprehensive platform that addresses the critical gaps in data protection, system migration, and business continuity. Every feature has been carefully crafted based on actual needs, real pain points, and the hard-learned lessons of its founder.
