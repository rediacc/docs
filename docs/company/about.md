# About Rediacc

Our mission is to help businesses operate with flexibility and resilience through innovative database solutions.

## The Beginning

The calendar showed September 2018. I had resigned (was an extremely difficult resignation) from the institution where I worked as a software engineer, wanting to code my own dreams. I could only sleep for maybe 4-5 hours due to excitement; I was working day and night. This pace continued like this for about 5-6 months. One day, two police officers showed up at my door. They told me that an investigation had been opened against me and that I was being called to give a statement.

It was a very long day. I spoke with police officers, a commissioner, a doctor, and finally, the prosecutor. All without any lawyer support. In short, they took my statement and then seized my high-tech computers and many disk drives from my home 'for a short time' to clone the data.

Until that time I had covered all my expenses, including my rent payments, car loan payment, and all the expenses of my startup entirely with other high-interest loans. I had no backup of my work, and even if I had, what could I have done? I had used completely on-premises hardware, and I no longer had the financial means to purchase new equipment. To pay off my debts and continue living with my wife and son, I had to return to a salaried job.

It took me "20 months" to get my devices back, and 3-4 years later, a non-prosecution decision was made, proving my innocence. During this time, I had drifted far from my dreams and started living in another world. The lawyers of the banks I owed money to were calling me every week. After the police, lawyers and bailiffs from three different banks started visiting our home.

## The Turning Point

Years later, I kept thinking about what I could do to prevent such a problem from happening again in the future. I needed a tool that would allow me to move my systems to another environment whenever I wanted, activate them whenever needed, back them up easily, and store them securely no matter where I moved them. Virtual machines weren't the answer, as I required native performance without the overhead of virtualization.

In 2021, I watched NetworkChuck's video, "you need to learn Docker RIGHT NOW!! // Docker Containers 101". Then I was shocked. I wanted to go out to the balcony and scream as loud as I could. I wished I had known about this technology earlier!

Still, this technology didn't solve all my problems. Moving container files from one system to another was difficult. I faced compatibility issues with file ownership, and most importantly, as the data size grew, transferring it took longer. Moreover, I had to keep services offline until system migration finished and the technology almost has nothing about security.

> "When they took my machines, I lost my work. But I found my purpose."

## Birth of Rediacc

It all started with the development of a portable file system logic. From there, I integrated a backup module. Then came one of the most critical challenges: enabling live system transfers with minimal downtime, regardless of data size. Then I added unique features based on my needs.

This is how Rediacc was bornâ€”a product forged through the toughest moments of my life. Now, it's available to everyone. Use it and don't let anything hold your business backâ€”be ready to accelerate.

## The Meaning of Rediacc

The name "Rediacc" has a rich dual meaning that reflects both our technological roots and our forward-thinking vision.

### Technical Origin

Initially, Rediacc was conceptualized as a GPU-accelerated version of Redis, the popular key-value store. While Redis stands for "Remote Dictionary Server," Rediacc was conceived as "Remote Dictionary Accelerated"â€”representing an evolution toward greater speed and performance.

Although the initial GPU-acceleration project required substantial R&D investment that led us down a different development path, the name retained its connection to this original technological ambition.

### Philosophical Significance

Over time, Rediacc took on an additional meaning: "Ready to Accelerate." This interpretation perfectly captures the essence of our current solution.

Rediacc embodies a harmonious blend of preparation and velocityâ€”symbolizing readiness for rapid change and progress. It represents:

- Immediate readiness for transformations
- Speed in implementing changes and innovations
- Accelerating businesses toward enhanced performance
- Maintaining velocity without sacrificing reliability

Our name reflects our mission to help businesses and developers operate with flexibility and resilience, ready to accelerate whenever opportunities or challenges arise.
