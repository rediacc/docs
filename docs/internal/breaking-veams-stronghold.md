# Breaking Veeam's stronghold: Pricing that disrupts the backup status quo

In today's enterprise backup landscape, Veeam dominates with complex licensing and premium pricing while customers struggle with mounting data volumes and ransomware threats. Our software challenges this status quo with innovative technology and a customer-first pricing strategy designed to build lasting relationships and maximize long-term revenue through sustained satisfaction rather than vendor lock-in.

## Competitive analysis: How Veeam prices today

Veeam's current pricing approach positions them as a premium vendor with corresponding high prices. Their transition from socket-based licensing to their Veeam Universal License (VUL) model has created both opportunities and pain points:

**Veeam's current approach:**
- Three-tiered structure (Foundation, Advanced, Premium) with increasing capabilities
- VUL workload-based subscription licensing (one license per VM/server/workload)
- Minimum purchase requirements (10 licenses standard, 5 for small business)
- Complex licensing with separate products for different workload types
- **Significant annual cost** for medium to large enterprises, often $30,000-$215,000+

**Key customer pain points with Veeam:**
- Higher costs when transitioning from socket to VUL licensing (2.6x increases reported)
- **Prohibitively expensive NAS backup** ($25K for 50TB over 5 years)
- Complex license management when merging legacy and new licenses
- Substantial renewal price increases (up to 28% reported)
- Basic features locked behind premium tiers

This creates our opportunity to disrupt with simpler, more transparent pricing that delivers superior value.

## Recommended tiered model: "Simple Scale"

Our "Simple Scale" pricing model is designed to be straightforward, customer-friendly, and built for long-term relationships. Unlike Veeam's complex approach, we offer:

### Four Clear Tiers

| Tier | Target | Base Monthly Price | Annual Commitment Discount |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Community** | Small business (up to 50 workloads) | $25/TB/month | 15% |
| **Professional** | Mid-market (50-250 workloads) | $35/TB/month | 20% |
| **Enterprise** | Large organizations (250+ workloads) | $45/TB/month | 25% |
| **Ultimate** | Mission-critical environments | $60/TB/month | 30% |

### Key Pricing Advantages:

- **Primary TB-based metric** (aligns with actual data volume rather than workload count)
- **No minimum purchase requirements** (start with exactly what you need)
- **Unlimited workloads** within your TB allocation (no per-VM/server costs)
- **Simpler licensing structure** (one product covers all workload types)
- **Predictable renewal pricing** (guaranteed max 5% annual increase)
- **Transparent multi-year discounts** that increase with commitment length

The TB-based approach means customers only pay for actual data protected, not arbitrary workload counts. This significantly reduces costs for high VM-density environments compared to Veeam's per-workload pricing.

## Feature distribution by tier

Our feature distribution strategy carefully balances accessibility with premium value, ensuring each tier delivers compelling capabilities while creating natural upgrade paths:

| Feature | Community | Professional | Enterprise | Ultimate |
|---------|------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Cross-backup technology** | ✓ (limited to 50% reduction) | ✓ (up to 80% reduction) | ✓ (up to 95% reduction) | ✓ (up to 99% reduction) |
| **Time travel recovery** | 30 days | 90 days | 1 year | Unlimited |
| **Zero-cost backups** | — | ✓ (basic) | ✓ (enhanced) | ✓ (advanced) |
| **Risk-free upgrades** | — | — | ✓ (limited instances) | ✓ (unlimited instances) |
| **Dynamic resource scaling** | — | ✓ (manual scaling) | ✓ (automated scaling) | ✓ (predictive scaling) |
| **Legacy database support** | — | — | ✓ (limited) | ✓ (comprehensive) |
| **Real-time cyber defense** | ✓ (detection only) | ✓ (detection + alerts) | ✓ (automated response) | ✓ (proactive protection) |
| **Support SLA** | Business hours | 24/5 | 24/7/365 | 24/7/365 + dedicated TAM |
| **Recovery time guarantee** | — | — | ✓ (standard) | ✓ (premium) |

**Strategic difference from Veeam:** We include core innovative technologies at lower tiers, making advanced capabilities like cross-backup and real-time cyber defense accessible to organizations of all sizes. This contrasts with Veeam's approach of restricting key features to higher-cost tiers.

## Pricing advantages over Veeam

Our approach creates multiple pricing advantages that directly address Veeam's weak points:

1. **Superior value on NAS backup** — While Veeam charges premium rates for file share protection (approximately $100/TB/year), our TB-based approach treats all data equally, delivering **70% savings on NAS backup protection**.

2. **Unlimited workloads** — Unlike Veeam's per-workload pricing that penalizes VM-dense environments, our TB-based approach lets customers protect unlimited VMs, servers, and applications within their data allocation.

3. **Predictable costs** — Our renewal guarantee caps increases at 5% annually, compared to Veeam's practice of charging "list price in effect at the time" (with reported increases up to 28%).

4. **Lower entry point** — No minimum license requirements, compared to Veeam's 10-license minimum (5 for Essentials).

5. **Advanced features in lower tiers** — Core technologies like cross-backup and cyber defense available at all tiers.

6. **All-inclusive approach** — One product protects all environments (on-premises, cloud, SaaS) without separate products and licenses.

## Optional add-ons and usage-based components

While our base pricing is comprehensive, we offer flexible options to address specific needs:

### Optional Add-Ons

| Add-On | Description | Pricing |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Immutable Archive** | Air-gapped, immutable backup storage tier | +$5/TB/month |
| **Enhanced SLAs** | Faster response times and shorter recovery windows | +20% of base subscription |
| **Managed Backup Service** | Expert management of backup operations | From $500/month |
| **Compliance Pack** | Advanced compliance reporting and documentation | +$2/TB/month |
| **Recovery Guarantee** | Financial guarantee for successful recoveries | Based on data criticality |

### Usage-Based Components (Pay-As-You-Go)

| Component | Use Case | Pricing |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Cloud DR Storage** | Only pay for cloud storage when used for DR | $0.03/GB/month (only when active) |
| **Burst Capacity** | Temporary capacity increases | Base price +25% for duration |
| **Recovery Testing** | Automated recovery validation | $100 per test |
| **Cloud Egress** | Data transfer during cloud recoveries | Pass-through cloud provider costs |

This approach provides maximum flexibility while maintaining simplicity, with core protection included in the base subscription and specialized needs available as add-ons.

## Conclusion

Our pricing strategy directly challenges Veeam's market position by offering superior technology with simpler, more transparent pricing that delivers clear value advantages. By focusing on customer outcomes rather than licensing complexity, we position ourselves as a true alternative to Veeam's dominant but increasingly outdated approach.

The TB-based metric, unlimited workloads within capacity, and more accessible advanced features create both immediate cost advantages and long-term value that will drive sustained growth and recurring revenue. Our promotional strategies provide compelling reasons to switch, while our enterprise options ensure we can accommodate the most complex customer requirements.

This "David vs. Goliath" approach doesn't just compete on price—it challenges the very foundation of how enterprise backup should be sold and delivered, creating a powerful market differentiation that will resonate with customers frustrated by traditional vendor practices.
