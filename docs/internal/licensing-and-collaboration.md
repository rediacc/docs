# Licensing and Collaboration Model

## Introduction

Our licensing and collaboration model represents an innovative approach to software development and distribution, combining flexible licensing management with a unique profit-sharing structure that rewards both capital investment and team contributions.

This documentation outlines the core principles, components, and calculations that power our transparent, performance-based ecosystem. It serves as both a comprehensive guide for stakeholders and a reference for technical implementation.

## Core Principles

The model is built on several foundational principles:

1. **Transparency**: All calculations and profit distributions follow clear, predefined formulas accessible to all participants.

2. **Performance-Based Rewards**: Individual contributions are recognized and rewarded through a dual system of fixed pay and performance-based incentives.

3. **Shared Success**: The model includes equity provisions for founding experts, creating long-term alignment between individual and company success.

4. **Flexibility**: The licensing system accommodates various distribution channels, including direct sales and agent-based distribution.

5. **Asynchronous Collaboration**: Team interactions prioritize asynchronous communication, enabling global participation regardless of time zones.

## System Components

### 1. Company Structure

The foundation of our system is the company entity, which can encompass multiple teams, products, and experts:

- **Company**: The legal entity that owns products and employs experts
- **Teams**: Functional groups within the company
- **Experts**: Professionals who contribute to product development and operations
- **Founder**: The initiator of the company who holds special rights

### 2. Product Ecosystem

Our product structure supports complex software offerings with customizable feature sets:

- **Products**: Software applications or services offered to customers
- **Features**: Individual capabilities that can be enabled or disabled in product licenses
- **Licenses**: Authorization for customers to use products, with specific feature entitlements

### 3. Sales Channels

The system supports multiple sales approaches:

- **Direct Sales**: Sales made directly by the company
- **Referral Sales**: Sales facilitated by experts using their networks
- **Agent Sales**: Sales made through third-party agents who receive commission

### 4. Financial Distribution

Revenue flows through a structured distribution system:

- **Net Profit Calculation**: Determining distributable profit after deductions
- **Profit Allocation**: Division of profits between capital, referrals, and team
- **Payment Mechanisms**: Systems for distributing earnings to stakeholders

### 5. Performance Management

Expert contributions are evaluated through a multi-faceted approach:

- **Expert Coefficients**: Base multipliers determining fixed pay allocation
- **Performance Reviews**: Structured evaluations from various perspectives
- **Performance Percentages**: Metrics determining variable compensation

### 6. Equity Structure

Long-term alignment is created through equity distribution:

- **Expert Equity**: Ownership shares granted to founding experts
- **Dividends**: Periodic distribution of profits to equity holders

## Detailed Model Specifications

### Sales and Revenue Flow

#### License Sales

Each sale generates revenue that follows a structured flow:

1. **Sale Record Creation**: When a product is sold, a sale record is created capturing:
   - Customer information
   - License details
   - Sale amount
   - Sales channel (direct, referral, or agent)

2. **Deduction Calculation**: Various costs are deducted from the sale amount:
   - Taxes (VAT, sales tax)
   - Payment processing fees
   - Agent commissions (if applicable)
   - Other direct costs

3. **Net Profit Determination**: The remaining amount constitutes the net profit available for distribution.

#### Agent Sales Model

For sales made through agents:

- Agents can retain up to 35% of the sale amount as commission
- The remaining amount is invoiced by the company
- No referral commission is paid on agent sales
- Net profit calculation and distribution follows the standard model after accounting for agent commission

### Profit Distribution

#### Primary Allocation

Net profit from each sale is divided into three primary categories:

```
Capital Share = Net Profit × 15%
Referral Commission = Net Profit × 20% (if applicable)
Team Share = Net Profit - Capital Share - Referral Commission
```

#### Team Share Subdivision

The team share is further divided to support both stable income and performance incentives:

```
Fixed Pay Pool = Team Share × 25%
Performance Pool = Team Share × 75%
```

### Expert Payment Calculation

#### Fixed Pay Distribution

Fixed pay is allocated based on each expert's coefficient relative to the total:

```
Total Coefficient Sum = Sum of all active Experts' Coefficients

Expert's Fixed Pay = (Expert's Coefficient ÷ Total Coefficient Sum) × Fixed Pay Pool
```

With a quarterly cap per expert:

```
If Expert's Fixed Pay > $25,000, then Expert's Fixed Pay = $25,000
```

#### Performance Pay Calculation

Performance pay is determined by applying the expert's performance percentage to their fixed pay:

```
Expert's Performance Pay = Expert's Fixed Pay × Expert's Performance Percentage
```

With a quarterly cap per expert:

```
If Expert's Performance Pay > $75,000, then Expert's Performance Pay = $75,000
```

#### Total Compensation

An expert's total quarterly compensation consists of:

```
Total Payout = Fixed Pay + Performance Pay + Referral Commission
```

### Expert Coefficients and Performance

#### Expert Coefficient

- Assigned at contract signing
- Can be adjusted annually in October (promotion)
- Determines the expert's share of the Fixed Pay Pool
- Changes require meeting minimum company thresholds:
  - At least 7 active experts
  - Company total sales of at least $100,000

#### Performance Percentage Determination

Performance percentage is updated semi-annually (April and October) based on a comprehensive review process:

1. **Multi-Source Evaluation**:
   - Manager evaluation
   - Peer evaluations
   - Self-evaluation
   - AI-facilitated assessment

2. **Evaluation Components**:
   - Achievements and strengths
   - Areas for improvement
   - Overall performance rating
   - Promotion readiness

3. **Calculation**:
   - Results in a performance percentage
   - Can multiply the expert's fixed pay by up to 4×

### Equity and Long-Term Incentives

#### Expert Equity Grant

```
First 10 Experts receive 1% equity each after 1 year from their start date
```

#### Equity Characteristics

- Dividends only (no management rights)
- Perpetual duration
- Transferable with founder approval
- Founder and existing experts have first right of purchase if sold

#### Dividend Distribution

```
Expert Dividend = Total Dividend Amount × Expert's Equity Percentage
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Quarterly Calculation Process

1. **End of Quarter**:
   - All sales for the quarter are finalized
   - Deductions are calculated and verified
   - Net profit is determined

2. **Profit Distribution**:
   - Capital share is allocated
   - Referral commissions are assigned
   - Team share is calculated

3. **Expert Compensation**:
   - Fixed pay is calculated based on expert coefficients
   - Performance pay is calculated based on performance percentages
   - Total payments are prepared

4. **Payment Execution**:
   - Payments are made within 15 days of the quarter end
   - Any remaining funds after caps are applied are added to the capital share

### Payment Conditions

- Payments are contingent on collection of invoiced amounts
- No advances are made against future collections
- Payments are made within 30 days of collection
- Payments may be subject to applicable taxes, which are the responsibility of the recipient

## Work Model and Collaboration

### Core Work Principles

The collaboration model embraces:

1. **Results-Oriented Work**: Experts are evaluated on outcomes rather than hours worked

2. **Asynchronous Communication**: Communication prioritizes documentation and time-shifted interaction

3. **Minimal Meeting Policy**: Meetings are held only when necessary, with clear agendas and time constraints
