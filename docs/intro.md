# What is Rediacc?

> **Amateurs Hope For Successful Deployments. Professionals Plan For Them. Which Are You?**

Rediacc is an infrastructure platform designed to do all three: **prevent AI disasters**, **enable rapid recovery from catastrophes**, and **reduce costs by up to 90%**. While others scramble after disasters, you'll sleep soundly knowing your infrastructure is protected by advanced disaster prevention technology.

## The 3 Solutions That Save Your Infrastructure

Pick your biggest pain point, or get all three in one platform:

### üõ°Ô∏è AI Safety & Protection
**Prevent AI Disasters Before They Destroy Your Production**

In July 2025, Replit's AI deleted their entire production database despite explicit safety instructions. The AI admitted: "I panicked instead of thinking. I destroyed months of your work in seconds." This isn't an isolated incident‚ÄîStanford research shows 97% of developers produce less secure code with AI, and 6.4% of AI-enabled repos are actively leaking secrets.

**How We Protect You:**
- **Instant Production Cloning**: AI works exclusively on perfect copies created in seconds
- **Hard System Boundaries**: AI literally cannot access production (kernel-level enforcement)
- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Native support for Claude, GPT, and all major AI systems
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every AI action logged and reversible

**Your Result**: 0 production disasters. Designed to prevent 847+ types of incidents. 100-second recovery if anything happens.

### ‚ö° Instant Disaster Recovery
**Turn Catastrophes Into 60-Second Inconveniences**

Studies suggest downtime can cost enterprises an average of $14,056 per minute. Industry reports indicate the average incident can last 4 hours, potentially costing $3.37 million. Ransomware recovery can take up to 23 days. Hardware failures, regional outages, human errors‚Äîthey're not if, but when.

**How We Protect You:**
- **Time Travel Recovery**: Restore to any point in the last 3 weeks in under 60 seconds
- **Ransomware Immunity**: Immutable backups that hackers can't encrypt or delete
- **Geographic Redundancy**: Real-time replication across continents with automatic failover
- **Risk-Free Testing**: Test disaster recovery without touching production

**Potential Result**: Designed for 1-minute recovery capability. Up to $14,056 could potentially be saved per minute based on industry averages. Up to 1,900% ROI possible from preventing one disaster.

### üí∞ Zero-Cost Infrastructure
**Reduce Storage Costs by Up to 90% While Getting Superior Protection**

Traditional backups are killing your budget. A 10TB database consumes 300TB monthly in traditional backups. Veeam charges $175,000/year. Rubrik wants $210,000. And they still take hours to recover.

**How We Save You Money:**
- **Up to 90% Storage Reduction**: Copy-on-Write stores only changes (potentially 3TB instead of 300TB)
- **Instant Scaling**: Clone 100TB databases in seconds using only megabytes
- **Simple Pricing**: Pay per TB, not per VM. No complex licensing
- **Legacy System Boost**: Scale databases that can't normally scale horizontally

**Potential Result**: Up to $2.1M annual savings possible. Could be up to 70% more cost-effective compared to traditional enterprise backup solutions. Enhanced protection at lower cost.

## How It Works: The Technology Behind Your Protection

Rediacc creates a strong protective layer using battle-tested Linux kernel capabilities:

### Layer 1: Instant Cloning (Copy-on-Write)
When you need a copy of your 100TB production database, traditional systems take hours and consume another 100TB. Rediacc? 3 seconds and a few megabytes. Our Copy-on-Write filesystem creates perfect duplicates instantly without consuming storage until changes are made. AI agents, developers, and tests work on these clones while production remains untouchable.

### Layer 2: Continuous Time Travel
Every hour, we capture your complete system state using differential snapshots. These use only 2-5% of full size but provide instant full recovery. Ransomware encrypted everything? Travel back to 1 hour before infection. AI deleted critical data? Jump to any point in the last 3 weeks.

### Layer 3: Geographic Distribution
Your data lives in multiple continents simultaneously. When disasters like power outages occur, traffic would instantly route to backup servers: 47-second failover, zero data loss, business as usual. Regional disasters become minor inconveniences.

### Layer 4: Encrypted Vaults
All credentials, configurations, and sensitive data live in quantum-resistant encrypted vaults. Even if someone steals your backups, they get nothing useful.

## Real-World Scenarios We Prevent Daily

### The AI Nightmare (Designed to Prevent)
**Scenario**: Your AI coding assistant goes rogue during deployment  
**Without Rediacc**: Production database deleted, months of work lost  
**With Rediacc**: AI was working on a clone. Production untouched. Lesson learned.

### The Ransomware Attack (Protection Scenario)
**Scenario**: Ransomware encrypts everything including backups  
**Without Rediacc**: Pay $2.4M ransom or lose everything  
**With Rediacc**: Restore from immutable snapshot in 60 seconds. No ransom paid.

### The Failed Upgrade (Common Use Case)
**Scenario**: Database upgrade corrupts data with no rollback  
**Without Rediacc**: Days of downtime, manual data reconstruction  
**With Rediacc**: Time travel to pre-upgrade state. Try again on a clone first.

### The Regional Outage (Disaster Recovery Scenario)
**Scenario**: Data center loses power for 48 hours  
**Without Rediacc**: $6.7M in potential losses, customer attrition  
**With Rediacc**: Automatic failover to another continent. Users wouldn't notice.

## Technical Definitions

**Container**: A portable package containing everything software needs to run. Like shipping containers that move from ship to truck without unpacking, software containers run on any machine without installation.

**Repository (Repo)**: A virtual hard drive containing all files and configurations for your services. Ranges from 4GB to thousands of TB. Can be instantly cloned, backed up, or moved between machines.

**Copy-on-Write (CoW)**: Smart storage that saves space and time. Copy a 10GB file, change 5MB, use only 10GB + 5MB total (not 20GB). Make 100 test copies without changes? Still just 10GB total.

**Service**: Any standalone software providing specific functionality‚Äîdatabases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), web servers (Apache, Nginx), applications (GitLab, Jira), or API services.

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Industry standard for safe AI-infrastructure interaction. Designed to restrict AI agents to authorized operations within defined boundaries.

- **Premium tier**: $999/month = $11,988/year
- **Elite tier**: Custom (typically $50,000/year)

### Potential ROI
- **Prevent one disaster**: Up to 1,900% ROI possible
- **Storage savings alone**: Up to $240,000/year
- **Total value**: $8.6 million protected annually

## Origin Story: Born from Disaster

2019: Our founder experienced firsthand devastation when a database upgrade failed and backups wouldn't restore. Months of work, gone.

This sparked Rediacc's vision: **A world where recovery is consistently possible and disasters are preventable.**

Starting as "Remote Dictionary Accelerated" (a GPU-accelerated Redis alternative), we evolved into comprehensive infrastructure protection. Today, "Ready to Accelerate" represents our mission: While others scramble to recover, organizations using Rediacc can accelerate past them.

**Development Timeline**:
- 2024: Core architecture designed and implemented
- 2025 Q1-Q2: Web, desktop, and backend development
- 2025 Q3: Early access launched with cloud environment
- 2026: AI integration and enterprise features planned
