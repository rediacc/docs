# What is Rediacc?

> **Amateurs Hope For Successful Deployments. Professionals Plan For Them. Which Are You?**

Rediacc is an **Infrastructure Automation Platform designed for AI-driven operations**. We solve the critical **Speed Mismatch in Modern Infrastructure**: As AI agents automate more infrastructure operations, they can modify systems in seconds‚Äîbut traditional recovery solutions still operate on timescales of hours to days. This creates a dangerous gap where AI-induced issues can cascade faster than human operators can respond.

We address **three converging market applications** that traditional backup vendors can't handle. They were built for earlier infrastructure challenges and typically require hours to weeks for recovery. AI systems can encounter issues much more quickly.

## Three Converging Market Applications

As AI becomes more prevalent in infrastructure operations, three distinct needs are converging into a single platform requirement:

### üõ°Ô∏è AI Safety & Protection
**Prevent AI Disasters Before They Destroy Your Production**

In July 2025, Replit's AI deleted their entire production database despite explicit safety instructions. The AI admitted: "I panicked instead of thinking. I destroyed months of your work in seconds." This isn't an isolated incident‚ÄîStanford research shows 97% of developers produce less secure code with AI, and 6.4% of AI-enabled repos are actively leaking secrets.

**How We Protect You:**
- **Instant Production Cloning**: AI works exclusively on perfect copies created in seconds
- **Hard System Boundaries**: AI literally cannot access production (kernel-level enforcement)
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**: Native support enabling AI systems like Claude Code, Gemini, and all major AI platforms to safely interact with infrastructure
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every AI action logged and reversible

**Your Result**: 0 production disasters. Designed to prevent 847+ types of incidents. 100-second recovery if anything happens.

### ‚ö° Instant Disaster Recovery
**Turn Catastrophes Into 60-Second Inconveniences**

Studies suggest downtime can cost enterprises an average of $14,056 per minute. Industry reports indicate the average incident can last 4 hours, potentially costing $3.37 million. Ransomware recovery can take up to 23 days. Hardware failures, regional outages, human errors‚Äîthey're not if, but when.

**How We Protect You:**
- **Time Travel Recovery**: Restore to any point in the last 3 weeks in under 60 seconds
- **Ransomware Immunity**: Immutable backups that hackers can't encrypt or delete
- **Geographic Redundancy**: Real-time replication across continents with automatic failover
- **Risk-Free Testing**: Test disaster recovery without touching production

**Potential Result**: Designed for 1-minute recovery capability. Up to $14,056 could potentially be saved per minute based on industry averages. Up to 1,900% ROI possible from preventing one disaster.

### ‚ö° Accelerated Development Operations
**Instant Environment Provisioning for Testing, Staging, and Development**

**Challenge**: Developers wait hours or days for production-like environments
**Solution**: Instant environment provisioning for testing, staging, and development
**Impact**: Reduces environment setup from days to minutes

**How We Accelerate Development:**
- **Instant Environment Cloning**: Clone entire production environments in seconds using Smart deduplication storage architecture
- **Smart deduplication Storage Architecture**: Reduces backup overhead by 3X-100X (depending on data change patterns) compared to full-copy solutions
- **Zero Infrastructure Investment**: Scale without additional hardware
- **Production-Like Environments**: Perfect copies created instantly for testing

**Result**: Environment setup that traditionally takes days now happens in minutes. Smart deduplication storage architecture enables up to 100X storage reduction while providing instant scaling capabilities. [Calculate your specific savings ‚Üí](/storage-calculator)

## How It Works: The Technology Behind Your Protection

Rediacc creates a strong protective layer using battle-tested Linux kernel capabilities:

### Layer 1: Instant Cloning (Smart deduplication Architecture)
When you need a copy of your 100TB production database, traditional systems take hours and consume another 100TB. Rediacc? 3 seconds and a few megabytes. Our Smart deduplication storage architecture reduces overhead by 3X-100X (depending on data change patterns) compared to traditional backup solutions. AI agents with MCP integration, developers, and tests work on these clones while production remains untouchable.

### Layer 2: Continuous Time Travel
Every hour, we capture your complete system state using differential snapshots. These use only a fraction of full size but provide instant full recovery. Ransomware encrypted everything? Travel back to 1 hour before infection. AI deleted critical data? Jump to any point in the last 3 weeks.

### Layer 3: Geographic Distribution
Your data lives in multiple continents simultaneously. When disasters like power outages occur, traffic would instantly route to backup servers: 47-second failover, zero data loss, business as usual. Regional disasters become minor inconveniences.

### Layer 4: Encrypted Vaults
All credentials, configurations, and sensitive data live in quantum-resistant encrypted vaults. Even if someone steals your backups, they get nothing useful.

## Real-World Scenarios We Prevent Daily

### The AI Nightmare (Designed to Prevent)
**Scenario**: Your AI coding assistant goes rogue during deployment  
**Without Rediacc**: Production database deleted, months of work lost  
**With Rediacc**: AI was working on a clone. Production untouched. Lesson learned.

### The Ransomware Attack (Protection Scenario)
**Scenario**: Ransomware encrypts everything including backups  
**Without Rediacc**: Pay $2.4M ransom or lose everything  
**With Rediacc**: Restore from immutable snapshot in 60 seconds. No ransom paid.

### The Failed Upgrade (Common Use Case)
**Scenario**: Database upgrade corrupts data with no rollback  
**Without Rediacc**: Days of downtime, manual data reconstruction  
**With Rediacc**: Time travel to pre-upgrade state. Try again on a clone first.

### The Regional Outage (Disaster Recovery Scenario)
**Scenario**: Data center loses power for 48 hours  
**Without Rediacc**: $6.7M in potential losses, customer attrition  
**With Rediacc**: Automatic failover to another continent. Users wouldn't notice.

## Technical Definitions

**Container**: A portable package containing everything software needs to run. Like shipping containers that move from ship to truck without unpacking, software containers run on any machine without installation.

**Repository (Repo)**: A virtual hard drive containing all files and configurations for your services. Ranges from 4GB to thousands of TB. Can be instantly cloned, backed up, or moved between machines.

**Smart deduplication**: Advanced storage architecture that reduces backup overhead by 3X-100X (depending on data change patterns) compared to full-copy solutions. Copy a 10GB file, change 5MB, use only 10GB + 5MB total (not 20GB). Make 100 test copies without changes? Still just 10GB total. This is the foundation of our competitive advantage over traditional backup solutions.

**Service**: Any standalone software providing specific functionality‚Äîdatabases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), web servers (Apache, Nginx), applications (GitLab, Jira), or API services.

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Industry standard for safe AI-infrastructure interaction enabling AI systems like Claude Code and Gemini to safely interact with infrastructure. Designed to restrict AI agents to authorized operations within defined boundaries.

## Origin Story: Born from Disaster

2019: Our founder experienced firsthand devastation when a database upgrade failed and backups wouldn't restore. Months of work, gone.

This sparked Rediacc's vision: **Infrastructure automation that can keep pace with AI operations.**

Starting as "Remote Dictionary Accelerated" (a GPU-accelerated Redis alternative), we evolved into an Infrastructure Automation Platform designed specifically for AI-driven operations. Today, "Ready to Accelerate" represents our mission: While others struggle with the speed mismatch between AI and traditional recovery, organizations using Rediacc can accelerate confidently.

**Development Timeline**:
- 2024: Core architecture designed and implemented
- 2025 Q1-Q2: Web, desktop, and backend development
- 2025 Q3: Early access launched with cloud environment
- 2026: AI integration and enterprise features planned
