# The Meaning of Rediacc

The name "Rediacc" has a rich dual meaning that reflects both our technological roots and our forward-thinking vision.

## Technical Origin

Initially, Rediacc was conceptualized as a GPU-accelerated version of Redis, the popular key-value store. While Redis stands for "Remote Dictionary Server," Rediacc was conceived as "Remote Dictionary Accelerated"—representing an evolution toward greater speed and performance.

Although the initial GPU-acceleration project required substantial R&D investment that led us down a different development path, the name retained its connection to this original technological ambition.

## Philosophical Significance

Over time, Rediacc took on an additional meaning: "Ready to Accelerate." This interpretation perfectly captures the essence of our current solution.

Rediacc embodies a harmonious blend of preparation and velocity—symbolizing readiness for rapid change and progress. It represents:

- The agile mindset necessary in today's fast-changing technological landscape
- The synergy between thoughtful preparation and swift action
- The essence of forward movement with adaptability

Our name reflects our mission to help businesses and developers operate with flexibility and resilience, ready to accelerate whenever opportunities or challenges arise.
