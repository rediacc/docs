# The Story Behind Rediacc

The calendar showed September 2018. I had resigned (was an extremely difficult resignation) from the institution where I worked as a software engineer, wanting to code my own dreams. I could only sleep for maybe 4-5 hours due to excitement; I was working day and night. This pace continued like this for about 5-6 months. One day, two police officers showed up at my door. They told me that an investigation had been opened against me and that I was being called to give a statement.  

It was a very long day. I spoke with police officers, a commissioner, a doctor, and finally, the prosecutor. All without any lawyer support. In short, they took my statement and then seized my high-tech computers and many disk drives from my home 'for a short time' to clone the data. 

Until that time I had covered all my expenses, including my rent payments, car loan payment, and all the expenses of my startup entirely with other high-interest loans. I had no backup of my work, and even if I had, what could I have done? I had used completely on-premises hardware, and I no longer had the financial means to purchase new equipment. To pay off my debts and continue living with my wife and son, I had to return to a salaried job.  

It took me "20 months" to get my devices back, and 3-4 years later, a non-prosecution decision was made, proving my innocence. During this time, I had drifted far from my dreams and started living in another world. The lawyers of the banks I owed money to were calling me every week. After the police, lawyers and bailiffs from three different banks started visiting our home.  

## The Turning Point

Years later, I kept thinking about what I could do to prevent such a problem from happening again in the future. I needed a tool that would allow me to move my systems to another environment whenever I wanted, activate them whenever needed, back them up easily, and store them securely no matter where I moved them. Virtual machines weren't the answer, as I required native performance without the overhead of virtualization. 

In 2021, I watched NetworkChuck's video, "you need to learn Docker RIGHT NOW!! // Docker Containers 101". Then I was shocked. I wanted to go out to the balcony and scream as loud as I could. I wished I had known about this technology earlier!  

Still, this technology didn't solve all my problems. Moving container files from one system to another was difficult. I faced compatibility issues with file ownership, and most importantly, as the data size grew, transferring it took longer. Moreover, I had to keep services offline until system migration finished and the technology almost has nothing about security. 

## Birth of Rediacc

It all started with the development of a portable file system logic. From there, I integrated a backup module. Then came one of the most critical challenges: enabling live system transfers with minimal downtime, regardless of data size. Then I added unique features based on my needs.  

This is how Rediacc was born—a product forged through the toughest moments of my life. Now, it's available to everyone. Use it and don't let anything hold your business back—be ready to accelerate.
