# Best Practices

This section provides recommendations and best practices for working with the Rediacc Middleware API to ensure security, performance, and maintainability.

## API Integration

### Authentication

- **Store credentials securely**: Never store request tokens in local storage or cookies. Use a secure, in-memory storage solution or a secure HTTP-only cookie with proper security attributes.
- **Implement token refresh**: Always use the new request token returned in each API response for the next request.
- **Handle session expiration**: Implement proper handling for authentication failures by redirecting to the login page.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for all API communication to prevent credentials from being intercepted.

### Error Handling

- **Implement robust error handling**: Always check the `failure` field and handle errors gracefully.
- **Display user-friendly error messages**: Translate technical error messages into user-friendly language.
- **Log errors**: Log detailed error information for debugging purposes but avoid logging sensitive data.
- **Implement retry logic**: For transient errors, implement an exponential back-off retry strategy.

### Performance

- **Minimize API calls**: Batch operations when possible and retrieve only the data you need.
- **Implement caching**: Cache rarely-changing data to reduce API calls.
- **Handle pagination**: For endpoints that return large datasets, implement client-side pagination.
- **Optimize payload size**: Only send the necessary data in request payloads.

## Vault Management

### JSON Structure

- **Use consistent JSON schemas**: Define and maintain consistent schemas for vault data.
- **Keep vault data compact**: Avoid storing large amounts of data in vaults; consider external storage for large datasets.
- **Include metadata**: Add creation and modification timestamps, author information, and version notes.
- **Validate JSON**: Always validate JSON before sending it to the API to avoid validation errors.

### Concurrency Control

- **Implement optimistic concurrency**: Always provide the current vault version when updating vault data.
- **Handle version conflicts**: If a version conflict occurs, retrieve the latest data, merge changes, and retry.
- **Avoid long transactions**: Complete vault updates quickly to reduce the risk of conflicts.
- **Lock UI during updates**: Prevent users from making multiple concurrent changes to the same resource.

## Security

### Password Management

- **Generate strong password hashes**: Use a secure, client-side hashing algorithm to generate password hashes.
- **Never transmit plain passwords**: Always hash passwords on the client side before transmission.
- **Implement password policies**: Enforce strong password requirements.
- **Support password rotation**: Encourage users to change passwords periodically.

### Access Control

- **Apply the principle of least privilege**: Assign users to permission groups with only the permissions they need.
- **Review permissions regularly**: Periodically audit and adjust permission assignments.
- **Use team isolation**: Organize resources by team to limit access scope.
- **Audit access**: Log and review access to sensitive resources.

### Data Protection

- **Encrypt sensitive data**: Use the vault system for all sensitive data.
- **Sanitize inputs**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs before sending them to the API.
- **Protect against XSS**: Escape or sanitize vault data when displaying it in the UI.
- **Implement data classification**: Label and handle data according to its sensitivity level.

## Organization

### Company Structure

- **Plan team organization**: Design team structure to match your organizational hierarchy.
- **Organize regions logically**: Structure regions based on geographic or logical divisions.
- **Centralize common resources**: Use company-level vaults for widely-shared configurations.
- **Document structure**: Maintain documentation of your organizational structure and resource relationships.

### Resource Naming

- **Use consistent naming conventions**: Establish and follow clear naming patterns for all resources.
- **Include resource type in names**: Prefix or suffix names with the resource type (e.g., "Server: Web" or "DB: Production").
- **Use hierarchical naming**: Reflect organizational hierarchy in resource names.
- **Document naming conventions**: Maintain a reference document for your naming standards.

## Integration Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

- **Implement polling**: Regularly poll for new queue items to process.
- **Use webhooks**: If available, configure webhooks for real-time notifications.
- **Implement event handlers**: Structure your application with handlers for different event types.
- **Handle idempotency**: Design your system to handle duplicate events gracefully.

### Microservices Integration

- **Use bridge separation**: Organize bridges to align with microservice boundaries.
- **Implement service discovery**: Use the API to discover and register services.
- **Share configuration**: Use vaults to share configuration between services.
- **Monitor service health**: Regularly check the status of services and machines.

## Development Workflow

### Testing

- **Create test environments**: Set up separate companies or teams for testing.
- **Use mock data**: Create realistic test data with the API.
- **Test error paths**: Verify that your application handles all error scenarios gracefully.
- **Automate tests**: Implement automated tests for critical API interactions.

### Deployment

- **Automate provisioning**: Script the creation of new resources.
- **Implement CI/CD**: Use the API in your CI/CD pipelines to manage deployments.
- **Maintain environment parity**: Ensure consistent configuration across environments.
- **Version resources**: Use vault versioning to track changes to configurations.

### Monitoring

- **Track API usage**: Monitor the volume and pattern of API calls.
- **Alert on failures**: Set up alerts for authentication failures or error spikes.
- **Monitor performance**: Track API response times and throughput.
- **Audit sensitive operations**: Log and review security-sensitive operations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Authentication failures**: Usually caused by using an expired or invalid request token.
- **Permission errors**: Check the user's permission group and ensure it has the required permissions.
- **Concurrency conflicts**: Caused by multiple users updating the same resource simultaneously.
- **JSON validation errors**: Ensure that vault data is valid JSON and follows your schema.

### Debugging Strategies

- **Check error messages**: The API provides detailed error messages to help diagnose issues.
- **Review logs**: Maintain comprehensive logs of API interactions.
- **Trace requests**: Use network tracing tools to examine request and response details.
- **Isolate components**: Test components in isolation to identify the source of problems.
