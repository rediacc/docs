# CLI Introduction

The Rediacc CLI is a powerful command-line interface that provides comprehensive access to the Rediacc platform's features. Built with Go and designed for automation, it enables infrastructure management, backup operations, team collaboration, and system administration from your terminal.

## Overview

The CLI communicates with Rediacc's middleware API to provide secure, authenticated access to:

- **Authentication & User Management** - Login, user creation, and session management
- **Company Administration** - Company setup, settings, and subscription management  
- **Team Management** - Team creation, member management, and collaboration tools
- **Infrastructure Operations** - Region, bridge, and machine management
- **Job Management** - Backup jobs, repository management, and scheduling
- **Configuration** - CLI settings, output formatting, and preferences

## Architecture

```
CLI (Go) ‚Üí HTTP/REST ‚Üí Middleware (.NET) ‚Üí SQL Server (Stored Procedures)
