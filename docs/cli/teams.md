# Teams Management

Teams are the core organizational unit in Rediacc for collaboration, resource management, and access control. This guide covers all team-related operations including creation, member management, and team configuration.

## Overview

Team operations include:
- **Team Management**: Create, delete, and configure teams
- **Member Management**: Add, remove, and manage team members
- **Access Control**: Team-based permissions and resource access
- **Vault Operations**: Secure team data storage

# Check your team memberships
rediacc teams list | grep '"isMember": 1'

# View teams you can manage
rediacc teams list --role admin

# Check specific team permissions
rediacc teams permissions "Development"
```

rediacc teams settings "$TEAM_NAME" set backup_retention "30d"
rediacc teams settings "$TEAM_NAME" set default_region "us-east-1"

echo "Team '$TEAM_NAME' provisioned successfully"
```

### Team Cleanup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Remove inactive team members

TEAM_NAME="$1"
DAYS_INACTIVE="$2"

# Get members inactive for specified days
INACTIVE_MEMBERS=$(rediacc teams members list "$TEAM_NAME" --output json | \
  jq -r --arg days "$DAYS_INACTIVE" \
  '.[] | select(.lastActive < (now - ($days | tonumber) * 86400)) | .userEmail')

# Remove inactive members
for member in $INACTIVE_MEMBERS; do
  echo "Removing inactive member: $member"
  rediacc teams members remove "$TEAM_NAME" "$member" --force
done
```
