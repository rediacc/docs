# Cross Backup

## Problem

The company becomes aware of the risks of backing up data **only on the same machine**:
- Hardware failures,
- **Cyber** attacks,
- **Physical disasters** like war, earthquake, fire, flood,
- Insufficient protection against data loss.

**Search for Solution:**
- It is decided to back up 20 TB of data to **a remote server**.
- However, with traditional methods, this backup takes **2 weeks** and occupies **90%** of the bandwidth.

## Crisis

After a customer call:
- It is noticed that **services are not working.**
- A **disk failure** is detected.
- When checking the remote backup server, it is understood that **the last backup was taken 3 weeks ago**.

**Results:**
- Manual disk recovery attempts **fail**.
- Due to 3 weeks of data loss, **customer contracts are canceled**.
- The company's **reputation is seriously damaged**.

## Rediacc Solution

1. **First Backup:**
   - The first time 20 TB of data is transferred to a remote server, it takes 2 weeks.

2. **Hourly Cross Backups:**
   - Every hour, a full backup perception is created, but **only changed data** is transferred.

3. **Preparation for Disaster Scenarios:**
   - Data can be backed up even to **intercontinental** servers.
   - Even if the main machine crashes, data from as recently as 1 hour ago is **activated within minutes**.

**Result:**
- Time Saving:
  - Backup time was reduced from **2 weeks to an average of 4 minutes**.
  - Data loss risk was reduced to **1 hour**.
- Cost Optimization:
  - Bandwidth consumption decreased by **98%**.
- Uninterrupted Business Continuity:
  - When the main server crashed, the remote backup was activated in **7 minutes**.
