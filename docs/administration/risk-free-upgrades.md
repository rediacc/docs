# 🔄 Risk-Free Upgrades

:::danger Crisis Scenario
During a database upgrade, an **unexpected error** occurred that prevented reverting to the old version or proceeding to the new one. Customers couldn't access systems, and 5000+ employees couldn't work.
:::

## 🔍 The Problem

Mehmet is an experienced system administrator who manages large-scale databases. He decides to **upgrade a 100 TB PostgreSQL database from version 13 to 14**. His plan:

1. **Take a backup** → However, backing up takes **7 days** due to data size
2. **Perform the upgrade on the weekend** → Departments are notified of an outage on **Saturday 01:00-05:00**

## 💥 Crisis Impact

* An **unexpected error** occurs during the upgrade
* The database **can neither revert to the old version nor proceed to the new version**
* Even external support teams cannot solve the problem

**Impacts:**
* Customers **cannot access payment and order systems**
* Company employees (**5000+ people**) cannot work
* **Reputation loss** and increasing complaints begin

:::warning Temporary Solution
* The last backup is loaded onto **a new server** → **Hardware cost doubles**
* Thursday and Friday data are **only in the live environment**, so data loss occurs
* **Two databases with different versions** are created → Inconsistencies increase
