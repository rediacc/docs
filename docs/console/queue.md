# Queue Management

The Queue Management interface is your mission control for distributed task execution, providing real-time visibility and control over all operations flowing through your Rediacc infrastructure. From here, you can monitor task progress, diagnose issues, and manage the entire lifecycle of queued operations.

## Overview

The queue system orchestrates distributed task execution using a sophisticated state machine:
- **Tasks** are created with specific operations and target machines
- **Bridges** poll for and claim tasks based on availability and assignment rules  
- **Machines** execute the actual operations via SSH
- **Results** flow back through the system with full audit trails

## Queue Interface Layout

The interface is organized into three main sections:

### Top Section: Filters and Controls
Powerful filtering options to find exactly what you need:

#### Team Selection Dropdown
- **Default**: "Select a team to view queue items" placeholder
- **Options**: All teams you have access to
- **Behavior**: Filters display to selected team's tasks only
- **Permissions**: Shows only teams where you have queue visibility

#### Status Filter
- **Default**: "All statuses" - shows everything
- **Options**:
  - PENDING - Awaiting bridge assignment
  - ASSIGNED - Claimed by bridge
  - PROCESSING - Currently executing
  - COMPLETED - Successfully finished
  - FAILED - Error encountered
  - CANCELLING - Termination in progress
  - CANCELLED - Successfully stopped
  - STALE - No recent updates
  - STALE_PENDING - Pending task with no updates (warning state)

#### Date Range Selector
- **Start Date**: Calendar picker with time
- **End Date**: Calendar picker with time
- **Divider**: Arrow icon between dates
- **Format**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- **Default**: Last 7 days of data

#### Task ID Search
- **Input**: Text field with search icon
- **Placeholder**: "Filter by Task ID (GUID format)"
- **Format**: Full or partial GUID (e.g., "f0103610" or complete UUID like "f0103610-8fef-4488-8cc8-60fc98bdf303")
- **Behavior**: Real-time filtering as you type
- **Case-insensitive**: Matches upper or lowercase
- **Note**: Task IDs are standard GUIDs/UUIDs in the format XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

### Middle Section: Options and Actions

#### Checkbox Filters
Three toggle options for fine-tuning your view:
- **‚òëÔ∏è Include Completed**: Shows successfully finished tasks (checked by default)
- **‚òê Include Cancelled**: Shows manually stopped tasks (unchecked by default)  
- **‚òê Only Stale Items**: Filters to only show tasks with no recent updates

#### Action Buttons
- **üîÑ Refresh**: Manual data refresh with spinning icon

- Check bridge status

**Machine Issues:**
- Tasks failing consistently
- Same machine affected
- Check connectivity

**Configuration Problems:**
- Immediate failures
- No processing time
- Review vault data

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Tasks Stuck in PENDING State

**Symptoms**: Tasks remain pending for extended periods

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. **Check Bridge Status**
   ```bash
   # Verify bridges are running
   ./bridge --bridge-mode status
   ```
2. **Validate Assignment**
   - Navigate to System ‚Üí Regions & Infrastructure
   - Verify machine has assigned bridge
   - Check bridge has "Access" status

3. **Review Capacity**
   - Check bridge batch_size setting
   - Monitor current processing load
   - Consider adding bridges if saturated

**Solutions**:
- Restart stuck bridge
- Reassign machine to different bridge
- Increase bridge batch_size
- Deploy additional bridges

#### High Failure Rates

**Common Causes & Fixes**:

| Error Pattern | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Immediate failures | Bad configuration | Check vault data |
| SSH connection errors | Network/credentials | Verify SSH keys |
| Timeout errors | Long-running tasks | Increase timeout |
| Permission denied | User privileges | Check machine user |
| Command not found | Missing dependencies | Install on machine |

**Investigation Process**:
1. Click **Trace** on failed task
2. Review complete error output
3. Check vault configuration
4. Test manually via CLI:
   ```bash
   ./rediacc term --machine <name> --command "<cmd>"
   ```

#### Stale Task Management

**Definition**: Tasks with no status update for 15+ minutes

**Common Scenarios**:
- Bridge crashed during execution
- Machine became unresponsive
- Network partition occurred
- Task genuinely long-running

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Identify scope**: Filter by "Only Stale Items"
2. **Check bridge health**: Review bridge logs
3. **Test connectivity**: Ping target machines
4. **Make decision**:
   - Cancel if genuinely stuck
   - Wait if legitimately long-running
   - Retry if transient issue

#### Performance Optimization

**Queue Bottlenecks**:

1. **Bridge Capacity**
   - Current: 3 tasks per poll (default)
   - Increase: `batch_size=10` for high volume
   - Monitor: CPU/memory on bridge host

2. **Priority Tuning**
   ```
   Highest ‚Üí Critical operations only
   High    ‚Üí User-initiated tasks
   Normal  ‚Üí Standard operations (default)
   Low     ‚Üí Background/maintenance
   ```

3. **Regional Distribution**
   - Deploy bridges closer to machines
   - Use region-specific bridges
   - Balance load across regions

- Automatic status changes without refresh
- New task notifications
- Completion alerts
- Real-time counter updates

#### Performance Metrics
Track key operational metrics:
- **Average Processing Time**: By machine, bridge, and task type
- **Success Rates**: Daily, weekly, monthly trends  
- **Queue Velocity**: Tasks processed per hour
- **Retry Patterns**: Identify problematic operations

### Automation Capabilities

#### Alert Configuration
Set up notifications for:
- Queue depth thresholds (e.g., >100 pending)
- Failure rate spikes (e.g., >10% in 5 minutes)
- Stale task accumulation
- Bridge offline events
- Specific error patterns

#### API Integration
Programmatic queue management:
```bash
# List queue items
curl -X POST https://api.rediacc.com/api/StoredProcedure/GetQueueItems \
  -H "Rediacc-RequestToken: $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"teamName": "Production", "status": "PENDING"}'

# Cancel task
curl -X POST https://api.rediacc.com/api/StoredProcedure/CancelQueueItem \
  -H "Rediacc-RequestToken: $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"taskId": "f0103610-8fef-4488-8cc8-60fc98bdf303"}'
```

#### Webhook Events
Subscribe to queue events:
- Task state changes
- Failure notifications
- Completion callbacks
- Stale warnings

### Queue Optimization Strategies

#### Load Distribution
1. **Time-based**: Schedule low-priority tasks off-peak
2. **Priority lanes**: Dedicate bridges to high-priority
3. **Regional affinity**: Keep tasks near data
4. **Resource pools**: Separate dev/prod queues

#### Failure Reduction
1. **Retry policies**: Exponential backoff
2. **Circuit breakers**: Stop cascading failures
3. **Health checks**: Pre-flight validation
4. **Timeout tuning**: Task-appropriate limits

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Team-based queue visibility
- Role-based action permissions
- Audit trail for all operations
- Encrypted vault data

### Best Practices
1. Never expose task IDs publicly
2. Rotate bridge tokens regularly
3. Monitor for unusual patterns
4. Implement queue ACLs
5. Use encrypted vaults for secrets
