## Login Process

### Standard Login

The Rediacc Console login page provides a clean, secure interface for authentication:

The standard login process requires three components:

1. **Email Address**: Your registered email address (e.g., admin@rediacc.io)
2. **Password**: Your account password  
3. **Client-Side Encryption Password**: For vault encryption (optional based on company settings)

### Login Steps

1. Navigate to the console URL (e.g., `http://localhost:7322/console/`)
2. Enter your email address in the first field
3. Enter your password in the second field
4. If vault encryption is enabled:
   - Enter your client-side encryption password in the third field
   - This password encrypts sensitive data locally before transmission
5. Click the "Sign In" button to authenticate

### Security Features

#### Token Rotation
- Each API request uses a rotating token system
- Tokens are automatically refreshed with each request
- Prevents token replay attacks

#### Session Management
- Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity
- Active sessions are extended automatically
- Multiple concurrent sessions are supported

#### Audit Logging
- All authentication attempts are logged
- Failed login attempts are tracked
- Session activities are recorded for compliance

## Vault Encryption

### Client-Side Encryption

When your organization enables vault encryption:
- Sensitive data is encrypted before leaving your browser
- Encryption password never leaves your device
- Master password is used to derive encryption keys

### Encryption Scope

The following data is encrypted:
- SSH private keys
- API credentials
- Database connection strings
- Custom vault data

### Interface Features

- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Click the eye icon to show/hide password text
- **Language Selection**: Choose your preferred language from the dropdown (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English by default)
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes using the sun/moon icon
- **Registration Link**: New users can click "Register" to create an account

:::info
The Client-Side Encryption Password field includes an info icon that provides additional context about its purpose. This field is optional and depends on your organization's security settings.
:::

:::warning
If your company has not enabled vault encryption, the client-side encryption password field will be present but not used during authentication. Contact your administrator to enable this additional security layer.
