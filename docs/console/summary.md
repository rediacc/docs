## Key Concepts

### Resource Hierarchy
```
Company
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Teams
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Users (with permissions)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Machines (compute resources)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Repositories (code/container storage)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage (external storage configs)
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Schedules (automated tasks)
```

### Infrastructure Components
- **Regions**: Geographic locations for resource organization
- **Bridges**: Queue processors that execute tasks on machines
- **Machines**: Physical or virtual servers where work is performed
- **Vaults**: Encrypted credential and configuration storage

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Created**: Task submitted to queue
2. **Pending**: Waiting for available bridge
3. **Assigned**: Bridge claimed the task
4. **Processing**: Task actively executing
5. **Completed/Failed**: Final status with results

1. Principle of least privilege
2. Regular permission audits
3. Deactivate unused accounts
4. Team-based isolation

### Operational Security
1. Regular audit log reviews
2. Monitor failed operations
3. Document critical changes
4. Test in development first

## Performance Tips

### Console Performance
- Use filters to reduce data loads
